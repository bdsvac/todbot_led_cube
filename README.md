# Todbot's LED Cube
Go here https://www.printables.com/model/229632-cube-of-rainbow-torment-led-cube-w-cheap-ws2812-ne and follow Todbot's instructions. 

I used a rp2040 https://www.adafruit.com/product/4884 with an AirLift Featherwing https://www.adafruit.com/product/4264 and a right angle usb c adapter https://www.adafruit.com/product/4432. I also only used 5 LED panels so the bottom is open.
