# Todbot's LED Cube

Go to https://www.printables.com/model/229632-cube-of-rainbow-torment-led-cube-w-cheap-ws2812-ne and follow Todbot's instructions. 

I used a [rp2040](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4884) with an [AirLift Featherwing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4264) and a [right angle usb c adapter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4432). I also only used 5 LED panels so the bottom is open. 

This project allows the LED Cube to connect to your wifi and host a page to allow you to control the cube.
